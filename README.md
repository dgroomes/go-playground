# go-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and experimenting with the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).

## Instructions

* Build and run a "Hello world" Go program:
    * `go run .`

## Learning Strategy

These are the components I'm using to guide my learning:

* [x] Set up instructions
    * I have my own installation instructions, including Bash autocompletion, in the section named "Install Go" in my
      personal [my-config](https://github.com/dgroomes/my-config/blob/main/mac-os/MACOS_SETUP.md).
* [x] [GoLand IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)
    * Make sure to enable Go modules integration in GoLand. See the below screenshot for the setting:

* [ ] [Official Go docs: *Tutorial: Get started with Go*](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started)
    * IN PROGRESS
* [ ] [Official Go docs: *
  Packages The Project Help Blog Play How to Write Go Code (with GOPATH)*](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code)

## Observations about Go

These are my observations about Go the programming language, the surrounding toolchain, the ecosystem of Go libraries,
and the Go community.

* It's really cool that you can add an import statement and then do `go mod tidy` to add the module as a requirement.
  That's an interesting inversion.
* I like the omission of commas in the import statement. When the compiler can just as easily make sense of a grammar
  without commas, in a certain context, then why require commas? Bash is comma-less, for example! I bet it's hard on the
  compiler and the IDE and will result in harder to read compiler error messages.
* GoLand doesn't have an [intention action](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/intention-actions.html) for converting a
  string to a raw string. I'm not sure why. Do raw strings work much differently than raw/multiline strings in other
  languages? I use this all the time in Intellij on Kotlin and JavaScript code.
* I really like that I can name a local variable `_` so that the Go compiler won't complain about an unused variable.
